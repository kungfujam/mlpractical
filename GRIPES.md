1. Stick to some set constants to refer to counts/max (this is especially important since matrices are 'the wrong way round'. Some suggestions: n/N - number of observations; d/D - Dimensionality of input; k/K - Dimensionality of output
1. Make diagrams consistent with notation i.e. indexing of w correct way round 
1. Consistent varable naming conventions. Suggesion: lower case single letter - scalar or D/K dimensional vector; upper case letter - N dimensional vector, or Matrix
1. Is there a specific reason the bias is kept separate? If not, for simpler matrix multiplication, why not include it within the parameter vector?
